<h2 class="oneline">Translator&rsquo;s Preface</h2>
<p>In a rare little volume in my possession, written
by William Sheldon, F.A.S., and published by
Isaiah Thomas, Jr., at Worcester, Mass., in
1810, over a century ago, the author introduces his
&ldquo;History of the Heathen Gods and Heroes of Antiquity&rdquo;
in the following quaint manner: &ldquo;People of
weak minds and of little learning, who have tasted
the Pierian spring but not drunk deep at it, when
they read an account of the Heathen Gods and Goddesses
and of the images dedicated to them, and
hear that the heathens were Idolators, or worshippers
of Images, give credit to these stories, without
any further inquiry or trouble. It may not, therefore,
be unnecessary to inform persons of this description,
that the people of all the nations which ever
existed under heaven have believed that there
existed one God, who is Almighty and the Maker
of all things. But there have been people who
believed also in inferior or subordinate gods, who
were agents or mediators between God and man;
and who were employed in carrying on the works
of Providence and of the creation or Nature.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vi">vi</div>
<p>This quaint effort to show the impropriety of
treating any description of religion with unnecessary
disrespect applies to this volume, which the
translator has adapted from the German. Our old
author might have added to his statement that
there is rare beauty and fascination in many of these
Grecian myths and that many a one has wished
with Wordsworth that he might</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea,</p>
<p class="t0">Or hear old Triton blow his wreath&egrave;d horn.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_vii">vii</div>
<p>The old gods and minor deities in these &ldquo;short
stories&rdquo; also appeal to us by their human qualities,
and many an important moral lesson may be
read in the fate of unfortunate minor deities who
offended the higher gods. The sketches are in
story form and are told in a refined and entertaining
manner. Several of the higher gods and goddesses
are not included in this volume, as they
appear most interesting in the other volumes in this
series&mdash;&ldquo;Achilles,&rdquo; &ldquo;Ulysses,&rdquo; &ldquo;Argonauts&rsquo; Expedition
and Labors of Hercules.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Prometheus</span></h2>
<p>Zeus (Jupiter), the mighty divinity, overcame
the Titans<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> and became the master
of the heavens and the earth. But notwithstanding
his hard struggle, he would not have
been victor had not Prometheus, the Titan, aided
him. At last Zeus, ruler in the skies, became the
enemy of Prometheus, who originated the hated
race of the Titans, and only awaited an opportunity
to punish him. He soon found the opportunity,
for Prometheus was attached to mankind,
whom Zeus intended to destroy, in order to people
the earth with a race of older creation. Prometheus
endeavored to dissuade him, but Zeus persisted
in his purpose. Then Prometheus said:
&ldquo;Have you forgotten that the curse of the dethroned
Cronus<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a> rests upon you and that by the
decrees of destiny a mortal only can deliver you
from that curse?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>When Zeus heard this, he decided to spare the
race of mortals. They were leading a wretched life
and were unconscious of the spiritual or intellectual
gifts conferred upon them by their creator.
They knew not how to fell the trees and build houses
to protect them against wind, rain, and the heat
of the sun. Like the beasts, they lived in dens
and caves which no ray of light penetrated. They
knew none of the signs of the approach of the fruit-bringing
Autumn, nor of Winter, nor blooming
Spring. Destitute of purpose or perception, they
lived like strangers in a barren world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>Prometheus pitied them. He explained to them
the rising and setting of the stars and taught them
how to recognize their orbits. He computed for
them their numbers, a marvellous feat, gave them
the power of recollection and the gift of writing,
that highest of the sciences. He made the ox a
useful servant to the race by placing the yoke
upon it and harnessing it to the cart. He bridled
the wild horse and showed them how to use it for
riding and drawing the wagon. They also learned
from him how to build vessels and manage sails.
He disclosed the depths of the earth to them with
its treasures of iron, silver, and gold. Up to this
time, men had no knowledge of plants or their
healing qualities. Prometheus taught them how to
avail themselves of this knowledge so as to relieve
pain and cure disease. He also imparted to them a
knowledge of what was transacted in the councils
of the gods and taught them to observe the flight
of the eagle.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>One element of comfortable living, however,
was lacking for mankind. It was fire. Prometheus
resolved to bring it to them from heaven, but the
ruler of the skies ordered him to desist. Watching
his opportunity, Prometheus soared aloft,
approached the chariot of the sun, and stuck a rod
which he carried in his hand in its blazing wheels.
Then descending like a falling star, he brought to
men the blessing of the fire.</p>
<p>Hermes (Mercury), the swift messenger of the
gods, saw this and at once brought the news to
the god father, Zeus. The all-powerful one wrathfully
directed Hermes: &ldquo;Up, hasten to Hephaestus
(Vulcan)<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> and say that the ruler of the gods needs
his service.&rdquo; Vulcan, god of fire, was also god of
all the artificers who are engaged with fire. He
was honored as the discoverer of all the implements
of the chase, the house, the field, and war, and was
also famous as the builder of the gold-gleaming
dwellings of the gods. So great was his skill that
he constructed bellows which could make the flame
stronger or weaker, as he wished, as well as sumptuous
couches which, at a sign from him, were placed
in the assemblies of the gods for their use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>When Hephaestus appeared before the ruler of
the skies, he was requested to make a maiden of
gold. He set about the work at once and when
Apollo, the next morning, mounted his flaming
chariot to shed the heavenly light both upon gods
and men, a splendid image was finished which in
appearance, speed, and movement resembled a beautiful
mortal. Zeus then ordered the other deities
to adorn the maiden, who was called Pandora,
most sumptuously. The celestial ones came at
once bearing gifts. From Athene (Minerva) she
received a girdle. The Horae (Hours) crowned her
with flowers and the Graces adorned her with exquisite
rings and bracelets. Mercury brought her a
pernicious gift, that of flattery and unfaithfulness,
which was to bring misfortune to men. Thus fitted
out with deluding charms and seductive graces,
Pandora was conducted to earth by the beautiful
winged messenger. From Zeus she had received a
golden box, which contained a multitude of evils
dangerous to men, and from which they had suffered
before Prometheus relieved them. Pandora
offered it to him as a gift from Zeus. The watchful
son of Titan, however, rejected the gift of the
god. Thereupon Pandora offered it to Epimetheus,
a brother of Prometheus. He was deluded,
forgot his brother&rsquo;s warning, and married the fascinating
Pandora. The false one immediately opened
the golden box and the multitude of evils from which
Prometheus had saved mortals spread themselves
abroad once more and men found themselves again
plunged into the very miseries from which they
had been saved by the son of the Titan. Thus it
happened that the seductive charm of woman
brought misery to mortals.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>Zeus again summoned Hephaestus and the two
giants, Kratos and Bia, and said to them: &ldquo;Seize
Prometheus, conduct him to the limit of earth, and
fasten him to one of the loftiest cliff walls of the
Caucasus.&rdquo; The giants undertook the task willingly,
but not so Hephaestus, who had compassion
for Prometheus. But at last he had to submit to
the will of the ruler of gods and men. Prometheus
was seized and taken to the desolate cliff. Reluctantly
Hephaestus went to work to fasten the son of
Titan with adamantine fetters to the cliff, while
Kratos and Bia helped in the task.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Noble Prometheus,&rdquo; said Hephaestus, &ldquo;it pains
my soul to lend my skill to such a deed as this.
What wretchedness awaits thee! Thousands of
years must pass and no end to thy suffering! Never
wilt thou have sight of one human being to comfort
thee. The strength of thy limbs will wane in the
heat of the sun and longingly thou wilt yearn for
the star-sown night to cover thee with its mantle
and bring coolness to thy burning wounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Hephaestus and the two servants of
Zeus left the fettered one, who cried out: &ldquo;Thou
sacred sky! Ye swift-winged winds! Thou billowy
thundering ocean! Earth, thou all-giver!
Sun, thou all-seer, I cry to you. Behold the fate
which has overtaken me, a deity. By the decree of
the ruler of all I must endure constant bitter pain
a thousand years. But I will submit to the decree,
knowing that the power of fate is irresistible.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>His groans were heard by the winged Oceanides in
the crystalline grotto of their father, Oceanus.<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> They
hurried to him and when they witnessed the fate of
the son of Titan, they filled the air with lamentation.
Sorrowfully they turned away. Soon appeared their
father, the gray Oceanus, upon his winged sea horse,
inquiring what Prometheus had done that he should
be exposed to such a dreadful penalty. When he
was told, he promised Prometheus to entreat mercy
from Zeus. But Prometheus admonished him,
saying: &ldquo;Well I know you have always been my
friend, worthy Oceanus, but I pray you do not
appeal to Zeus for me. It would avail me nothing
and only prejudice Zeus against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concealing his deep grief in his heart, Oceanus
left the tortured one.</p>
<p>A long time passed. Zeus, believing that the
Titan&rsquo;s obstinate spirit had been broken, sent his
winged messenger, Hermes, to him, who said: &ldquo;Zeus
desires to know what you heard from your brother
about that marriage which, if he enters into it, will
some time precipitate his ruin. You know it and have
found how severely he punishes the theft of the
fire. So anger him no longer, but tell him what he
wishes to know.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>Prometheus replied: &ldquo;Never shall Zeus know
what he desires to learn until I am freed from my
fetters and relieved of my torments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hermes returned to the ruler of the skies and told
him that Prometheus, in spite of his unspeakable
torments, still remained obstinate. Zeus stormed
wrathfully and decided to subject his victim to
still more dreadful punishment. All at once black
clouds gathered over Caucasus, fiery thunderbolts,
hurled by his hand, shook the lofty jagged cliffs,
and the roar of the hurricane filled all the space
between the sky and earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wrathful, implacable deity,&rdquo; cried Prometheus,
&ldquo;I know this is the manifestation of thy power,
but thou canst not move me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>Then he heard a fearful bellowing issuing from the
depths, the earth shook, and great waves hurled
themselves upon him and the cliff to which he was
fastened. A year ran its course, and when finished,
Zeus again dispelled the darkness about the cliff,
but with no intention of mitigating Prometheus&rsquo;
punishment. On the other hand, he determined
to make it harder. He sent a vulture who attacked
his body and devoured his liver. This torment
was renewed daily, for every night his liver grew
again. Zeus also vowed that as Prometheus, being
a god, could not die, he should hang on the cliffs of
Caucasus forever. And thus it happened through
many generations of men.</p>
<p>At last the spirit of Titan&rsquo;s son was broken and
he longed for peace and freedom. The other Titans
who were once overcome by Zeus and hurled into
Tartarus, had long regained their freedom. Reconciliation,
however, seemed impossible, for Zeus had
once vowed he would not send away the vulture
and strike off his fetters unless a deity should undertake
to descend into dark Tartarus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>At this time Heracles (Hercules), a son of Zeus
by a mortal, was traversing the world, fighting
every monster which was endangering the human
race. In his travels he came to Caucasus. To his
utter astonishment he saw the son of a god fastened
there and asked him why he had to endure such
agonies. Thereupon Prometheus told him of his
fate and Hercules determined to rescue him. Throwing
aside his lion skin and club, and taking a
poisoned arrow from his quiver, he shot the vulture,
tore his claws from the Titan&rsquo;s groin, and threw
him into an abyss. Then Hercules released him
from his chains and conducted him to Zeus. Prometheus
unwillingly announced to him that a marriage
with the beautiful sea nymph Thetis would
be his ruin. The reconciliation, however, was not
complete, for Zeus&rsquo; vow was not yet satisfied. He
gave Prometheus a gold ring in which Hephaestus
had set a little stone from the Caucasus. &ldquo;Promise
me always to wear this ring,&rdquo; said Zeus, &ldquo;and
my vow may be accomplished.&rdquo; Prometheus took
the ring and made the promise. Then Hercules
fetched Cheiron, whom he had unintentionally
wounded with a poisoned arrow, to the deity.
Cheiron, who was suffering unspeakable torments
and longed to die, gladly descended into Tartarus.
Thus the conciliation was complete.</p>
<p>Warned by Prometheus, Zeus married Thetis to
a mortal, King Peleus. At once a multitude of lovely
sea nymphs came to escort the bride and groom in
festal procession. Zeus and the other divinities
also joined in the festivities and celebrated the
marriage of the beautiful sea nymph.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Deucalion and Pyrrha</span></h2>
<p>The human race, which had been steadfast
under misfortune, could not bear good
fortune. It became sensual, effeminate,
and haughty. Zeus heard of this human degeneracy,
assumed human form, and betook himself to
earth to discover how much of truth there was in
these evil reports. He found a worse state of things
than he had feared. Every kind of abomination
prevailed. At the close of day he went to the palace
of Lycaon, king of Arcadia. To those assembled
there he gave a sign that a deity was present. They
immediately began to pray. Then said the king:
&ldquo;Let us see whether this is a deity or a mortal like
ourselves.&rdquo; If mortal, he resolved to slay him in
the night. He first of all prepared a banquet for
him. He cut the throat of a man who had been
sent to him by the people of Molossia to be scourged,
took the still quivering members, threw some of
them into boiling water, and placed the rest of them
upon a spit and held them over the fire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>When Zeus saw this he shook the earth and at
once the mighty castle was in ruins. The king fled
in terror to the fields. He tried to speak, but his
voice was an awful howl. And as his voice changed,
so did his whole body. He had hair instead of garments
and his arms became feet. As a wolf, with
eyes glaring, with a longing for blood, and with the
action of the wild beasts, he sprang among the
herds and his teeth were covered with the blood of
the strangled animals.</p>
<p>Zeus not only determined to punish Lycaon, but
prepared for the destruction of the whole human
race. He betook himself to Olympus, entered his
golden palace, called the other deities together, and
announced his decision to them. Some approved
of it; to others the word of their master caused
pain and they said: &ldquo;Who will build us sacrificial
altars in future if the race of mortals is destroyed?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>Zeus promised to people the earth with another
and better race and seized his thunderbolts to hurl
them over all the earth. But suddenly he feared
that the storm of fire might spread through the whole
sacred firmament and reduce the universe to ashes.
Therefore he dismissed the one-eyed Cyclops, who
forged his bolts, and decided to destroy the world
by a deluge. He summoned &AElig;olus, god of the
winds, and ordered him to retain in his grotto the
winds which dispel the rain clouds and release only
the south wind. This was done. The south
wind immediately spread its heavy, wet wings
over sea and land, its foreboding face was concealed
by the night, mists covered its brow, its heavily
waving beard dripped with rain, and from its curls
torrents of water poured down. Zeus pressed the
cloud with his broad hand and at once the thunder
resounded through immeasurable space. Swiftly
the goddess Iris ascended and descended her seven-hued
rainbow, drawing water from the agitated sea
and filling the clouds. All growing things were
bent to the ground and it was not long before the
husbandman&rsquo;s hopes disappeared before the raging
flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>Poseidon (Neptune), god of the sea, was the ruler
in the universe most actively engaged in the work of
destruction. He ordered the rivers to break through
the dikes and overflow the land. He himself rode
over the sea in his chariot and excited it so that it
hurled its foaming waves upon the shore. Then he
smote the earth with his golden trident so that it
trembled and the water covered every place. Trees,
houses, and temples fell before the wrath of the
flood. The rush of the storm drowned the piteous
shrieks of men, who, sitting in the trees or upon
ridge-poles, vainly stretched out their hands to the
darkened heavens. Others fled in multitudes to
the mountains to save themselves among the
peaks. But higher and higher rose the flood.
Some died of fright, some of despair. Others,
bereft of reason, rushed aimlessly here and there,
until with horrible shrieks they were swallowed up
in the raging flood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The waters soon flowed over the tops of the highest
mountains and only the sky and water were
visible. Here and there men rowed in boats, and
tigers and lions vainly sought to save their lives by
swimming. The sheep were in no danger from the
wolves when the flood swept among them. Every
animal perished. Even the birds, which can remain
long in the air, at last sank with tired wings into
the water.</p>
<p>Only one place was free from water, the heights
of Parnassus, which tower among the clouds. There
a small boat was caught in which were Deucalion,
king of Thessaly, and his spouse. They lifted
their voices and implored a nymph dwelling in a
grotto near by to save them. Zeus saw them clinging
to the wall of the height, and knowing that they
were the only god-fearing ones among the thousands
who had perished, decided to let them live. So
the winds following the rain clouds were checked
and the blue sky smiled once more and Apollo
ascended in his flaming chariot. Poseidon stilled
the sea. He gave a signal with his trident and the
vast tide ebbed. Then he called his son Triton,
ruler of the depths of the sea, who dwelt there in a
golden house with his mother Amphitrit&eacute;. He was
half man and half fish, with a bluish scaly skin.
Triton appeared and Poseidon ordered him to call
back the floods and streams which had swept over
the land. In obedience to his father&rsquo;s request
Triton raised his wreathed shell and from sunrise
to sunset sounded a blast which called all the waters
back to their depths. The flood receded, mountains
and hills appeared above the water, and gradually
the plains and forests and devastated fields became
visible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>Deucalion and Pyrrha left their boat, and as he
looked around him at the widespread desolation he
said: &ldquo;Oh my spouse, bound to me by ties of kindred
and marriage, behold, we are the only human
beings in the wide world. How wretched would it
then have been if death also had overtaken me! If
thou hadst been swept away by the flood I should
have followed after thee, for without thee I could
not have lived, best beloved! Oh! would that I
possessed my father&rsquo;s divine power of creating men
and bestowing life upon them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>Tears choked his voice and Pyrrha wept also.
At last they decided to implore Themis<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a> to have
mercy and relieve them in their sore straits, and
repaired to the temple of the goddess. What a
spectacle! The aisles were covered with slime and
the fires upon the altars were extinguished. They
fell upon their knees, kissed the cold stones, and
prayed: &ldquo;Divine, all-gracious, and merciful one,
behold! Empty is the world! We alone remain of
all its mortals. Oh pity us and let us once more
live among people like ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once through the halls of the temple resounded
these words: &ldquo;Leave the temple, cover your
heads, loosen your girdles, and throw behind you
the bones of your great mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were mute with astonishment for a time, but
at last Pyrrha said with trembling voice: &ldquo;Be not
angry with me, oh goddess, that I cannot throw my
mother&rsquo;s bones behind me. Thereby I should disturb
the dear one now wandering among the shades
in Tartarus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sadly they descended the temple steps, Deucalion
meditating over the mysterious message to them.
At last the shadows of grief in his heart were
dissipated and he said: &ldquo;Best beloved, the
goddess intends no harm to us. I believe this
is the meaning of her message. The earth is the
mother, the stones are her bones. So we will
throw them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>They began at once to obey the goddess&rsquo;s message.
They loosened their girdles, covered their
heads, and threw stones behind them. Suddenly
life began to manifest itself in the stones. They
began to enlarge and take shape. Soon they
resembled blocks of marble which the sculptor is
fashioning in human form. The softer parts were
changing to flesh, the harder to bones. At last
appeared the forms of living persons. The stones
which Deucalion threw behind him became men and
those which Pyrrha threw became women. Thus
was the earth repopulated with beings made of
stone&mdash;a race of strong minds and stout bodies.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hermes (Mercury)</span></h2>
<p>Hermes was the son of Zeus and Maia,
daughter of Atlas the Titan, eldest brother
of Prometheus. His divine descent was
revealed on the very first day by his extraordinary
shrewdness and ingenuity, for he arose at
noon from his cradle and hurriedly left the dark
grotto of his mother. Espying a speckled tortoise
feeding in the high grass, and laughing at the
sight, he cried out: &ldquo;Welcome, pretty one! It is
well said where thou abidest there is neither anger
nor witchcraft, and yet I think I will kill thee to
make of thy shell a pleasant plaything.&rdquo; Thereupon
he seized the tortoise with both hands, went
back to the grotto, and killed the animal. He perforated
the speckled shell, inserted pegs in the openings,
covered the whole with ox-hide, added a neck
to it, and strung seven well-toned strings. It was
all accomplished in the twinkling of an eye. He
tested the strings and, behold, they resounded powerfully
and harmoniously to his song. As he sang,
another emotion filled his soul. He bethought himself
of flesh, for he already had an appetite for
well-prepared tasteful meat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>As the sun-chariot disappeared beneath the red
gleaming waves of Oceanus, he took his well-toned
lute and came at twilight to the shadowy mountains
of Pireas, where the cattle of the Sun-god feed
in luxuriant meadows. The crafty child enticed
fifty of the herd to follow him and made them go
backwards so that the hoof tracks would be concealed.
That his own footsteps should not betray
him, he took tamarisk and myrtle twigs and wove
magic sandals with them. Thus he wandered,
driving the herd before him, by many devious ways
over blooming meadows and darkly wooded heights.
At last night waned and the soft light which Selene
(Luna) sends down when Apollo sinks in Oceanus
was dissipated by the rosy shimmer of Eos (Aurora)
in the smiling eastern sky.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>When Hermes reached the river Alpheus with the
cattle, he herded them and kindled a fire. He then
seized two of them by their horns, threw them to the
ground with great strength, and killed them with a
sharp steel. Then he took the best pieces and
spread them on wooden spits, but saved the skins
for drying. Next he divided the flesh in twelve
parts and offered them to the twelve highest
Olympian deities. As he saw the smoke of offering
rising to the skies, a longing seized him to learn
from the flesh whether he belonged to the divine
race which is nourished by nectar and ambrosia.
But his exalted intelligence restrained him from
the experiment. He left the flesh untouched, surrounded
it with dry pieces of wood, and burned it
together with the heads and hoofs of the animals.
As the smoke rose, he threw his sandals into the
Alpheus and hastened back to the grotto. Lightly
as the breeze he slipped through the oval opening,
sprang into his cradle, and like a playful child
took his lute in his left hand. But his mother
was not deceived and she scolded him for his long
absence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>The rosy Aurora spread over the morning sky,
and when Apollo rose in his chariot with its heavily-maned
white steeds he looked down upon the lonely
meadows and missed the cattle. Amazed, he looked
for the tracks of their feet, but nowhere found a
trace of them, and no sign that man or god had
been that way. He came to Onchestus, where he
found an old man, keeper of a vineyard, and asked
him about it. The old man replied: &ldquo;It was a wee
child who swung a wand with his hand and drove
the herd away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apollo thought of Hermes and betook himself to
Maia&rsquo;s grotto. When Hermes saw the Sun-god&rsquo;s
dazzling face he buried himself deeper in the snow-white
sheets and pretended to be asleep. But Apollo
saw through the cunning of the child. He searched
through the cavern and opened all the spacious
chambers. In one he saw nectar and ambrosia and
plenty of gold, in another chests of cedar filled with
the purple and snow-white garments of the nymph.
But as he nowhere found what he sought, he stepped
to the cradle and said: &ldquo;Cunning boy, arise and show
me the cattle you carried off. If you do not hasten
to obey me, I will hurl you without mercy into the
blackened depths of Tartarus, from which no one
can rescue you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>As Hermes struggled to rise, Apollo seized him
and took him to Zeus, who, after hearing the Sun-god&rsquo;s
complaint, laughed loudly and released his
cunning son. After giving some living cattle to
the Sun-god, Zeus kept Hermes and he became the
deity of barter and business and the swift messenger
of the gods. All ways were soon known to
him and his winged feet bore him with the swiftness
of the wind over land and sea.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Pha&euml;thon</span></h2>
<p>Clymene bore a son, named Pha&euml;thon, who
grew up a handsome and stately youth.
His father was Ph&oelig;bus (Apollo), the Sun-god.
Once, when he boasted of his heavenly descent,
his companions laughed at him. Shame and
anger filled the youth&rsquo;s heart and he resolved,
upon the advice of his mother, to ask the Sun-god
himself if he were not his father. After wandering
through Ethiopia and India, he at last reached
Apollo&rsquo;s palace. Lofty columns, some made of
solid gold, others of fire-colored rubies, dazzled
him. Their splendid pediments were made of polished
ivory and the folding door of lustrous silver,
the work of the artistic divinity, Hephaestus. There
too were to be seen upon the billows of the sea the
horn-blowing Triton, near him gray Proteus, whose
office it is to protect the sea god&rsquo;s seals, and Doris,
with her daughters, the Nereids.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> Some of these
sea maidens were represented as sitting upon the
rocks and drying their green hair, others, riding
upon dolphins. Above them was the arching
firmament.</p>

<p>Pha&euml;thon approached the palace, but for a spell
remained in the hall at a distance, for the brilliancy
which emanated from the sparkling crown of
his progenitor blinded him. Apollo, with a purple
robe flowing from his shoulders, sat upon a golden
throne gleaming with jewels. To the right and left
of him stood the year, the month, the day, and
the hours. Golden-tressed Spring was adorned
with a wreath, and Summer, with sheaves of corn.
Autumn carried a red basket with golden grape
clusters on her head, and Winter could be recognized
by his icy beard and silver hair.</p>
<p>Apollo, delighted with the sight of his blooming
son, said: &ldquo;What is it, Pha&euml;thon, that has brought
you here?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Divine father,&rdquo; replied the son, &ldquo;they mock at
me when I call you father. Give me some proof
that I am your son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon Apollo took his sparkling crown from
his brow, called his son to him, and embracing him
said: &ldquo;What your mother has told you is true. I
am Apollo, your father. That you may know it
beyond all question, ask anything of me. Whatever
it may be, it shall be granted. I promise you
this by the Stygian Lake, the dark waters of the
underworld; and such a vow, as you well know, is
inviolate for us deities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had his father finished speaking before
Pha&euml;thon, with sparkling eyes, replied: &ldquo;I pray you
let me drive your sun-chariot and winged steeds
for one day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>How Apollo regretted his vow! With mournful
visage he shook his head and spoke. &ldquo;Woe is me
that I must keep my promise. Had I not made it,
your wish would not have been granted. But now
I can do no more than warn you. The fulfilment of
your wish will result in dreadful dangers. What
you desire is so great a task that your youth and
strength are not equal to it. You, a mortal, wish
to be immortal. None of the Olympian gods
themselves would undertake such a task. It is
known to them as to mortals that I alone can drive
the sun-chariot. Zeus himself, mightiest of the
gods, who holds the thunderbolts in his hand and
rules over heaven and earth, would not dare to
drive it. Learn now the dangers which threaten
you. Only with the greatest exertion can the
freshly harnessed steeds climb the upward morning-path.
It is a fearful sight to gaze down from the
summit of the sun-course. My own heart trembles
when I reach that spot. Then the path descends,
growing more and more steep. To accomplish it
needs a sure hand. Thetis herself, who awaits me
in the waves, looks up anxiously, fearing I may not
be able to make the downward plunge. And this is
not all you must learn. The heavens revolve around
you constantly, and the high stars weave in circles.
The goal must be firmly kept in sight in spite of the
furious oscillation and you must not deviate from
the course. Oh son, ask yourself seriously if you
can do this. Think of this, too. Far otherwise
will the sky appear to you than it does from the
earth. You will not journey to cities nor to groves
with lofty temples, but you will encounter apparitions
of wild animals, at sight of which the blood of a
mortal will turn to ice. How can you manage these
ungovernable fire steeds which I can hardly bridle,
so great is their strength? Therefore, oh son,
abandon your wish. There are so many things in
heaven and earth better worth the asking which I
can give you. The granting of your wish means
your destruction.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The deity&rsquo;s warnings were useless. Pha&euml;thon
repeated his request. As Apollo was bound by his
vow, he led the youth to the sun-chariot, which was
a gift from Hephaestus. The axles were golden,
as well as the shafts and the rims of the wheels, but
the spokes were of solid silver. The shafts and the
harness glittered with chrysolite and other precious
stones. While Pha&euml;thon was gazing at the chariot
in astonishment, Eos opened the purple door leading
to the halls in which the flowers of heaven at
all times bloom. The stars disappeared, the morning
star, last of the gleaming choir, faded and finally
was lost to view. When Selene (Luna) had sunk
beneath the sea, Apollo summoned the blessing-giving
Hours whose duty it was to harness the
steeds to the sun-chariot. With light step the rosy
divinities betook themselves to the hall, loosed
the white steeds from their marble cribs, filled with
ambrosia, led them to the chariot, and placed their
trappings on them while Apollo besmeared his
son&rsquo;s face with a sacred ointment so that he should
not be blinded. Then he placed the sparkling crown
upon his beautiful tresses and said with a sigh:
&ldquo;Since I cannot dissuade you, at least take this
advice to heart. Do not urge the horses with the
goad, for they go swiftly enough, but hold the reins
securely, try to restrain their fiery snorting and govern
them safely. Avoid the South as well as the
North Pole and keep to the course indicated by the
ruts of the wheels. Observe further that it is necessary
sky and earth should be equally warm. Go
neither too high nor too low, lest you burn either
the heavenly mansions or the dwellings on earth.
May Fortune help you in all other things, so
now take the reins and think of my advice. It
would be vastly better for you to desist from your
ruinous folly that I to-day, as usual, may furnish
light for men and gods.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>During these last words the headstrong youth
mounted the chariot and took the reins from the
hands of his sorrowful father. The neighing of the
steeds filled the atmosphere. They champed their
bits and stamped. When Pha&euml;thon pulled the reins
they flew with the chariot. They soon outran the
swift winds, clove asunder the morning clouds, and
the vast, immeasurable universe lay before Pha&euml;thon&rsquo;s
gaze. The chariot swung from side to side
as the load was too light. When the steeds noticed
this, they took to wild flight and left the usual
course. The youth was overcome by fear. How
could he find the course again? Not once but many
times he sought to free the tangled reins. Upward
went the chariot. When Pha&euml;thon looked upon the
height of the sky, a panic seized him, his knees
trembled, and all grew dark before his eye. Now
he repented that he had not heeded his father&rsquo;s
warnings, but it was too late. He was hurled
about like a dismasted vessel in raging waters. He
knew not what to do. He had already traversed a
great part of the sky, but endless was the expanse
which still lay before him. In despair he looked
ahead and behind. He still held the reins, but he
no longer made any effort to direct the steeds. A
great terror awaited him as he suddenly beheld
frightful apparitions above him. Terrified by them,
the steeds ran still farther from the course, dragging
the swaying, cracking chariot after them.
The elevated plains of earth took fire. Broad fissures
appeared in the ground, the forest disappeared
in a furious sea of flame, and a luminous dust arose
from the meadows and harvest fields. Cities and
their people were destroyed. Fiery clouds swept
over places teeming with life shortly before. The
mountains were masses of seething fire. Pha&euml;thon,
gazing about, saw nothing but flames. Higher and
higher they rose, and at last the sun-chariot was
surrounded by clouds of hot moisture. Pha&euml;thon
no longer knew where he was. Then, so says the
myth, the terrified nymphs fled, mourning over their
fountains and waters destroyed by fire. The earth
became such a vast chasm that the glare of the fire
was reflected in Tartarus and the gods of the underworld
were terrified. The sea itself retreated from
its shores, its bed rose, islands appeared where there
had been none, fishes and seals lay dead upon the
banks. The sea nymphs fled with Doris and Nereus
to a cool grotto, where the air was so glowing that
Poseidon had to plunge in water the arm with which
he raised his trident to try and hurl Pha&euml;thon down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>When Zeus beheld what was happening he pitied
the dying world. With a thunderbolt he killed the
audacious charioteer. A lock of his hair, taking
fire, floated down like a falling star. The terrible
bolt frightened the steeds. The chariot broke and
axles, spokes, and fragments of the wheels flew in
all directions.</p>
<p>Pha&euml;thon fell into the river Eridanus and the
naiads of the stream came to bury his body.
Apollo, who had seen all that happened to his son,
sorrowfully veiled his face.<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Orpheus</span></h2>
<p>Orpheus was the hero-singer of the Thracians,
who in the ancient times dwelt
at the foot of the mountains Olympus,
Parnassus, and Helicon. He was the son of Apollo<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
and the muse Calliope<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> and the husband of Eurydice.
His name became so celebrated among later
poets that his power of song was said to have produced
most marvellous effects. When he struck
his lute, the fable says, the lions of the forest fawned
upon him like dogs, rivers halted in their course,
and the trees and rocks listened to him. He
accompanied the Argonauts on their expedition
and accomplished by his music many marvellous
escapes for them. When he returned from the
expedition his young wife, Eurydice, and her companions
danced upon a beautiful grass plat one day.
While engaged in their sports a snake stung her in
the foot and she died in the very bloom of her youth.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>
The inconsolable husband poured out his grief in
tones that filled all hearts with sorrow. Taking his
lute, he ventured to the entrance of the underworld,
Tartarus, and entreated Persephone, spouse of
Hades, god of the underworld, to give him back
Eurydice. The bars of the gate flew back as he
sang. With ever tenderer tones he approached the
place where departed spirits wander. Cerberus, the
three-headed dog who guards the entrance, quietly
wagged his tail as he passed, Ixion&rsquo;s wheel stood
still,<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> and Sisyphus stopped his fruitless task to
listen to him.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Persephone graciously heard Orpheus&rsquo; entreaty
and said: &ldquo;Go back whence you came. Eurydice
shall silently follow. But have a care that you do
not look at her until you have reached the upper
world. If you gaze at her but an instant she will
be lost to you forever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orpheus turned back. He had not yet seen her.
Would she follow him or not? A goddess surely
would not deceive him. But he heard no step
behind him. Singing, he went his way for a time,
and when in the distance he saw the gleam of the
upper world, he cried &ldquo;Eurydice&rdquo; in tender, eager
tones. No answer was made. Overcome by grief
and anxiety, he forgot the warning of the goddess.
An irresistible desire to see her caused him to turn
his head, and behold his wife was quietly and lightly
following him. He stretched out his arms to her
and in an instant the goddess&rsquo;s warning was realized.
Eurydice suddenly went back and was never again
seen by him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>His soul was rent with anguish. He wandered
despairingly with his lute in the Thracian forest,
where he found among the rocks a swarm of
M&aelig;nades, those creatures who foregather at the
festivals of Bacchus and, excited with wine and
wild debauches, go through the woods inciting
everyone to attend the revels which are given in
honor of that divinity. They made a loud clamor
by clashing their cymbals together and blowing
trumpets and horns and swung their wands, wound
with vine leaves and ivy, called the thyrsus, crying,
&ldquo;Evoe, Evoe, Bacchus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These M&aelig;nades who found Orpheus lamenting for
Eurydice, snatched his lute away and ordered him
to entertain them. With horror he turned from
them and rejected their importunities. That was
too much for a horde of mad women. They stoned
him, tore him to pieces, and threw his bleeding
limbs into the forest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Atalanta</span></h2>
<p>Sch&oelig;neus married in Arcadia and entreated
the gods to send him a son. When his spouse
bore him a daughter, he became so enraged
that he took the child from her mother, carried her
into the wilderness, and left her there. The child
was nourished by a bear until she was found by some
hunters, who took her away, brought her up, and
named her Atalanta.</p>
<p>Atalanta grew in beauty and strength and became
a vigorous huntress, surpassing all men and youths
in daring, swiftness, and skill. Like Artemis, she
chose to live unmarried and paid no attention to the
youths who solicited her hand. When hard pressed
she at last made this condition. He only should
have her as wife who surpassed her in running; but
those who were defeated should die.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>Hard as the condition was, the beauty of the
maiden attracted a crowd of suitors. Among them
was Hippomenes, who came not to take part in
the race, but to deride the youths who would risk
their lives by such folly. But when the race began
and he saw the beautiful huntress, he himself was
smitten with love and hoped that none of the youths
would win the prize, so that he might take Atalanta
home as his wife. The race was finished. The
maiden returned with the wreath of victory on her
head, but the youths were taken away to suffer
death.</p>
<p>Then Hippomenes stepped forward and said:
&ldquo;It was not much glory, O Atalanta, to surpass
those. Now I wish to race with you. Should fortune
favor me, it will be no shame for you to be
beaten by one who is great grandson of Poseidon,
god of the waters, and whose courage is not inferior
to his skill. But should you win, your name will
be honored in future days.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>Atalanta looked upon the bold youth, and as he
was pleasing in her sight she was uncertain whether
she wished his victory or his defeat. Then she
said: &ldquo;What divinity, O youth, seeks your destruction
by giving you the desire to race with me?
Those foolish ones, they tried and now must die.
At least let me warn you to seek some other maiden.
If you reject my advice, I bespeak for you the help
of the gods that you may be the winner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the beautiful huntress thus spoke, Hippomenes
called to Venus, who suddenly stood by
his side, unseen by Atalanta. She gave him three
golden apples gathered in the gardens of the Hesperides,
and told him how to use them. The trumpet
sounded and both started swiftly over the course.
What a sight it was to watch the beautiful creature
whose feet scarcely touched the ground!
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;she could skim over the waving
wheat without bending it, or fly over the sea without
wetting the soles of her feet.&rdquo; The encouraging
shouts of his friends greeted the youth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>Hippomenes was overjoyed at the greetings, and
Atalanta noticed it with pleasure. It seemed unendurable
to her to be beaten, but it was even more
painful to beat and thereby sacrifice Hippomenes&rsquo;
life. For a long time they ran side by side. At
last Hippomenes threw an apple to the ground. The
maiden saw the rolling gold and stooped to pick
it up. The delay threw her back in the race, but
she soon caught up with the youth. He threw the
second apple. Running out of her course she seized
it and Hippomenes gained further advantage. He
was nearing the goal when he heard the distant
applause of his friends. The maiden put forth all
her power and soon flew past Hippomenes with burning
cheeks, so that his death seemed inevitable.
Then he supplicated the goddess and threw the
third apple, which rolled far out of the course.
The maiden would have left it, but Aphrodite
(Venus) induced her to get it. The goddess made
the task so difficult that Hippomenes reached the
goal first. The judges crowned him and Atalanta,
as she had promised, gave him her hand.</p>
<p>The day of their marriage was the day of ruin
for both, for they wholly forgot the goddess and
neither made thank-offerings nor remembered her
kind assistance. Aphrodite therefore decreed a
severe penalty. The angry goddess changed them
into a pair of lions and harnessed them to her
golden chariot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Tantalus</span></h2>
<p>Tantalus, a rich and powerful king, was
deemed worthy by Zeus to visit the gold-gleaming
mansions of the gods on high
Olympus and to partake of nectar and ambrosia at
their tables. Zeus and the other immortals even
deigned to appear under Tantalus&rsquo; roof, to sit at
his table, and converse in his own speech. Such an
honor was too great for a mortal to bear. Inflated
with pride, he made himself hated by gods and men.
He not only made sport of the names of the immortals
and uttered falsehoods, but he would reveal
their decrees to mortals and steal nectar and ambrosia
for his friends. He at last grew so audacious
that he was warned and threatened by the
gods. Finally his penalty overtook him. Upon
one occasion when the gods were visiting him and
partaking of a banquet, he decided to test just how
far they were omniscient. He killed his son Pelops,
prepared his flesh as a test, and set the disgusting
food before them. All recognized the unnatural
deed of the father except Ceres, whose heart was
full of sorrow over the loss of her daughter.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a> So it
happened that she partook of the food, and ate of
the shoulder of Pelops. Zeus collected the parts of
the body, substituted an ivory shoulder, recalled
Pelops&rsquo; soul from Tartarus, restored him to life,
and then plunged Tantalus into Hades to suffer endless
torment.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>When Tantalus regained consciousness, he found
himself standing up to his chin in water. Overcome
with burning thirst, he bent his head to drink. But
the more he bent his head the lower the water
receded, and at last sunk into the ground, leaving
nothing at his feet but dry, black dust. As he
raised his head the water raised, only to disappear
whenever he tried to drink. Over his head
hung branches loaded with fruit. Between the
green leaves were pomegranates, balsamic pears,
olives, figs, and spicy apples, but whenever the
victim raised his hands to pluck them, a wind
drove the branches away from him. His torment
was endless. A restless longing never to be satisfied
was the punishment inflicted upon him by the
revengeful divinity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Salmoneus, Sisyphus, Ixion, and Phlegyas</span></h2>
<p>Salmoneus was a brother of Tantalus, whom
Zeus punished so severely for his audacity.
A similar fate overtook him also, for he had
a spite against the gods and strove to be equal to
them. He snatched the offerings intended for
Zeus from his altars and commanded that they
should be offered to himself. He imitated Zeus&rsquo;
thunderbolts with lighted torches, which he threw
down upon the people, and represented thunder
by the clashing of iron vessels. In fact he imitated
the ruler of the universe in every way.</p>
<p>When he had reached the summit of his insolence
his ruin overtook him. Zeus struck him with one
of his bolts and hurled him down to Tartarus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>Sisyphus was in the same dreadful place. In the
upper world he had been guilty of thefts both among
men and the gods. In the very hour of his death
he perpetrated an evil deed. He seized and bound
Thanatos, the god of death, with brazen bands, and
for a long time no one died on earth. The gods of
the underworld sent to Zeus this message: &ldquo;Behold
Thanatos, who went to the upper world to bring
Sisyphus here, has not returned. For several
days no shade has entered our dark kingdom.&rdquo;
Thereupon Zeus sent for the powerful war god,
Ares,<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> and ordered him to find the god of death.
He soon found and released him from his fetters,
and Sisyphus was taken to the underworld by Thanatos.
Even then he continued his deceitful deeds.
He said to his wife: &ldquo;Do not bury my body and
make the customary death offering to the gods of
the underworld.&rdquo; Then he appeared before Hades
and Persephone and said: &ldquo;My wife has not buried
my body and has neglected to make the death offering.
Let me go to her and remind the faithless one
of her duty. Then I surely will return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>His wish was granted and he returned to the upper
world. As he did not come back, word was again
sent to Zeus, who despatched the swift-flying Hermes
to take the deceiver back. When Sisyphus
saw the divine messenger, his courage gave way,
for he knew that no mortal could outdo him in cunning.
Hermes took him back to the dark kingdom,
where a fearful penalty awaited him. He had to
roll a huge block of marble up a high mountain
which no sooner reached the top than it went thundering
down. He had to begin his task over again
with sweat of toil and anguish dropping from his
brow to the earth.</p>
<p>Ixion, who had offered violence to the goddess
Hera,<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> suffered another penalty. He was tied to a
wheel which never ceased revolving. Phlegyas,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>
who burned the temple of Apollo, was also there.
He was continually threatened by a rock hanging
over his head, which exposed him to constant
apprehension and unspeakable torture.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IX</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Niobe</span></h2>
<p>Amphion, who married a godlike maiden
named Niobe, ruled over Thebes. She
became the mother of seven stately sons
and seven blooming daughters.</p>
<p>She would have been esteemed the most blessed
of mothers if she could have borne her happiness
with moderation. Her husband Amphion was well-nigh
equal to the divine singer Orpheus in song and
lute playing, while in possessions and power she surpassed
most princesses of her time. But more than
all else she prided herself upon her children.</p>
<p>The prophetess Manto went through the streets
and ordered the Theban women to the altars of
Latona. &ldquo;Arise, you women,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;twine
your tresses with fresh laurel and bring fragrant
incense for the mother of Apollo and Diane.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>The women immediately assembled at the altar
of the goddess and supplicatingly scattered incense
in the sacred flames. Hardly had they begun the
offering song when Niobe appeared, proudly advancing.
She wore a gold-embroidered cloak and on
her brow gleamed a diadem. Standing before
the altar, she raised her head proudly and said:
&ldquo;Foolish ones, would you honor Latona and refuse
incense at my altar? Was not my father, Tantalus,
a guest at the tables of the gods? Atlas, who
carries the world&rsquo;s axle on his shoulders, is my ancestor.
Zeus is another. My power extends even in
far-off Phrygia. The stones with which Cadmus
built this city and its castle dance to the music of
my husband&rsquo;s lute. Wherever you look in my palace
you find inexhaustible treasures. But it is my
richest fortune to be the mother of seven stately
sons and as many blooming daughters. And yet
you offer to Latona, who has borne but two, Apollo
and Artemis (Diane)! Do you not know, foolish
ones, how she was persecuted by Juno when the
hour of her delivery approached? She could find
refuge neither in heaven nor on earth, so contemptuously
was she regarded! At last the island of
Delos pitied the fugitive and said to her: &lsquo;Thou
wanderest about restless, like myself, and so I
have compassion for thee and offer thee refuge.&rsquo; She
remained at Delos and bore the Twins who are so
highly esteemed by mortals&mdash;Apollo and Diane.
But am not I with my fourteen children more blest
than she with two? She is almost childless, but I
am rich in children. So take the laurels from your
brows and leave the altar of the goddess who is far
less fortunate than I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>The Theban women reluctantly acceded to her
request. Holding their wreaths in their hands,
they stole away, but did not forget to supplicate
their goddess in light murmurs.</p>
<p>Latona was angry at the insult which Niobe
offered her. She called her children, Apollo and
Artemis, and said to them: &ldquo;Behold, my children,
how that woman has dishonored me and how the
Theban women have forsaken my altar!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>While the goddess was requesting them to avenge
her shameful treatment, Apollo interposed and
said: &ldquo;Say no more, divine mother, your wrongs
shall be speedily righted.&rdquo; Artemis said the same.
Thereupon they betook themselves to the castle
built by Cadmus. Nearby they found the fields
covered with the tracks of horses which Niobe&rsquo;s
sons were driving about. Suddenly Ismenos, the
eldest, cried out in agony. Behold, his heart
was pierced with a silver arrow shot by Apollo from
a cloud with his unerring bow. The youth paled
at the sight and his gold-mounted bridle dropped
from his hands. He raised his head again and fell,
dying, from his horse.</p>
<p>When Sipylus saw this, terror seized him and
he sought to escape. But his fate overtook him.
The arrow was shot at him with such skill that it
pierced his throat. Plunging forward, his blood
ran down his steed&rsquo;s white neck and a moment after
he fell lifeless to the earth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>Two sons skilled in the ring stood breast to breast
and the same fatal arrow pierced both. Alphenor,
seeing them fall, threw himself upon them with
loud lamentation. His death came quickly, for
his body was also pierced by an arrow. His moans
had hardly ceased when Damasichthos fell wounded
in the knee. While trying to stanch the wound, a
second arrow pierced him and he sank dead to the
earth. The youngest of the sons, Ilioneus, alone
remained. The beautiful boy fell upon his knees
and thus implored: &ldquo;All ye gods, spare me!&rdquo; Apollo
was touched, but it was too late, for the fatal arrow
was already on its way and reached its mark&mdash;the
heart of the supplicating one.</p>
<p>A cry of anguish ran through the city. When the
king learned what had happened, despair seized
him and he ran his sword through his body. Niobe
also heard of the horror, but could not believe it.
She hurried to the field and found the bleeding bodies.
How everything had changed for her who but a
short time before had been so boastful! Her face
was pitiful to look upon. Even her enemies felt
compassion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>She threw herself down, now upon this body,
now upon that, and covered them with kisses and
tears. Her hair hung down and the blood of her
sons stained it and her garments. She raised her
arms and wildly cried: &ldquo;Revengeful Latona, now
satisfy your delight in my sufferings. My sons&rsquo;
death is my death. Triumph, dreadful one, for
thou hast overcome me. But no, for I am still
richer than thou.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hardly had these words escaped her lips before
the dismal twang of the bow was heard anew.
Horror seized upon the people and the seven
daughters who were rushing to the spot. Niobe
did not quail. Misfortune had stupefied her. One
of the daughters, while seeking to draw the arrow
from the heart of Ilioneus, was pierced and fell
upon his body. Another, while consoling her
mother, fell dead. Thus one after the other was
killed until only the youngest was left. She fled
to the lap of her mother, who covered her with her
cloak. &ldquo;Only this one is left to me, Implacable
One, only this one,&rdquo; exclaimed Niobe in despair.
The death cry was heard, and she held in her arms
a bleeding body.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>The mother sat amidst her murdered children,
rigid with sorrow. Her face was like white marble.
Her tongue clove to the roof of her mouth. The
blood stood still in her veins. Her whole body
turned to stone. A storm swept past with a
frightful roar. Lo, tears of stone fell from her
eyes. Suddenly the hurricane carried her upon
its wings and left her among the rocky crags of
Sipylus.<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>A marble block is there to-day and every morning
the cold marble weeps.</p>

<h2 id="c10"><span class="h2line1">Chapter X</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Bellerophon</span></h2>
<p>Bellerophon, grandson of Sisyphus, received
from the gods both beauty and manliness,
but the heavenly gifts wrought his
ruin. Hardly had Queen Antia looked upon him
before she forgot her duty to the king and tried to
win him for a husband. When Bellerophon learned
her purpose, he turned from her with abhorrence.
Thereupon she determined to destroy him, and said
to her husband: &ldquo;Kill that profligate who has
tried to make me faithless to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>The king&rsquo;s heart was filled with anger when he
learned this, and yet he was reluctant to kill the
youth himself. So he wrote a letter and sent Bellerophon
with it to his father-in-law, the prince of the
rich country of Lycia, who extended hospitalities to
him and gave a feast in his honor, which lasted several
days. Bellerophon then took the letter, whose
contents he did not understand, and gave it to the
prince. He was amazed when he read that Bellerophon
must die, and disliked to deprive so handsome
a youth of his life.</p>
<p>Finally he ordered him to fight with the dreadful
Chim&aelig;ra, a monster having the fore part that of a
lion, the middle that of a goat, and the hind part that
of a dragon, which continually emitted fire from its
jaws. The gods, compassionating the innocent one,
sent Pegasus, the winged horse, to him, so that he
could raise himself in the air. But he could not
catch the horse. Wearied with his exertions, he
slept by the edge of a spring. Athene appeared to
him there, gave him a golden bridle, and said:
&ldquo;Make an offering to Poseidon, the sea god, and he
will aid thee.&rdquo; When the youth awoke he was holding
the bridle in his hand. He at once made the
offering and erected an altar to Athene. Then he
started to catch the horse, which came to him of its
own accord. He placed the golden bridle on it and
in his brazen armor vaulted upon the back of the
divine steed. It extended its wings at once and
took him to the lair of the Chim&aelig;ra.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>Now the battle began. His steed sinking towards
the earth, Bellerophon hurled a lance at the animal
which penetrated deep into its back. Roaring with
rage and pain, the monster reared its dragon body
and emitted flames. But its exertions were useless,
for Pegasus flew still farther upwards with the youth.
It writhed upon the ground and sought to pull out
the bronze spear with its jaws. Then it crawled
over the fields, streaking them with blood. Bellerophon
followed it, when suddenly it coiled itself
up as if dead. But it did not deceive him. From
on high he shot down a deadly arrow which pierced
through its mane into its neck. It sprang up again,
but could not reach the youth. Hardly had it
sunk down to the ground before another arrow
was driven through its eyes. Fearful was its roar.
Men and beasts fled far away in terror, but Bellerophon
was not afraid. Unerringly he shot the third
arrow, which struck the monster between the vertebr&aelig;
and pierced the marrow. Spouting fire and
blood, it died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>When Bellerophon returned from his battle, still
harder tasks awaited him. He had first to encounter
the famous Solymi and then the bold Amazons.
With the aid of the gods he was victorious, but on
his homeward way new danger awaited him. The
king sent out a troop of his most valiant men against
him and they approached the unsuspecting Bellerophon
from an ambush. But it was of no avail,
for after a short battle he overcame them. When he
appeared before the prince, the latter said: &ldquo;Surely
thou art innocent and a favorite of the gods, else
thou couldst not have escaped all these dangers.&rdquo;
He loved him from that moment and gave him his
daughter to wife.</p>
<p>Rich in possessions and honors, Bellerophon
lived in Lycia. But his good fortune did not last
long. He attempted to fly to heaven with Pegasus
to participate in the assemblies of the gods.
His efforts were useless and he lost their favor.
Pegasus was frightened and threw his rider to the
earth, who fell into a field called Aleius because he
wandered in it blind the rest of his life. Joyless
were his days and at last he died, his heart broken
by sorrow. But Pegasus was placed among the
stars.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Perseus</span></h2>
<p>Acrisius was king in Argos. It was once
foretold that he would be killed by the
son of his daughter, Dana&euml;. Thereupon
he shut up his daughter and her son, Perseus by
name, in a chest and threw it into a raging flood.
The gods pitied the innocent ones and directed it to
the island of Seriphus.</p>
<p>The kings of the island, Dictys and Polydectes,
were one day drawing a net from the sea. Great
was their astonishment when they found a chest
in the net and heard sorrowful moanings in its interior.
They opened it and the noble Dana&euml; stepped
out with her beautiful son. Dictys took them home
with him and cared for them as if they had been
his own brother and sister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>When Perseus reached his young manhood, he
surpassed everyone in skill and dexterity in martial
sports. Polydectes conceived evil designs
against the innocent Dana&euml;, and as he feared Perseus
he decided to send him out of the country. He
soon found the opportunity. He gave a banquet
to the leading men of the island, at which he announced
that he was going to take a wife. He also
required each one of them to procure a beautiful
horse for a wedding gift. In his youthful presumptuousness
Perseus said: &ldquo;Whatever you wish
I promise to do. Even should you request the head
of the Gorgon, I would procure it for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The king replied: &ldquo;Bring me the Gorgon&rsquo;s head,
but know this: If you do not keep your word, your
mother Dana&euml; shall make compensation.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Troubled in mind, Perseus went to the seashore
and confided his fears to the waves. Hermes, the
divine messenger, at once appeared and promised
his assistance. He conducted him to the house of
Night in the extreme limits of the earth, where
there is neither the golden light of the sun nor the
mild lustre of the moon. The daughters of Phorcus,
the monster, who were gray at birth, dwelt
in that fearful darkness. They had but one eye
and one tooth, common to them all. The fearless
Perseus snatched from them both eye and tooth.
They raised a frightful clamor and implored the
youth to restore them. &ldquo;It shall be done,&rdquo; said
Perseus, &ldquo;if you will show me the way to the
nymphs.&rdquo; They did so, and he returned them.</p>
<p>From the nymphs he received the cloak of Pluto,
the winged shoes of Mercury, and the shield of
Minerva. He donned the cloak which rendered him
invisible, and fastened the winged shoes to his feet.
Hermes gave him a sword. Then he rose in the air
with his winged feet and in a trice reached Oceanus.
There dwelt the sisters, the terrible Gorgons, whose
heads were covered with snakes. The chill of death
struck those who looked upon them, their breath
left them, and they turned to stone. The monsters
slept with their faces turned downwards.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>As Perseus courageously approached with his
drawn sword, Hermes and Athene suddenly stood
at his side, instructing him how to begin so as to
keep his word. &ldquo;Advance so you do not see the
faces,&rdquo; said they, &ldquo;lest they turn you to stone.
Draw your sword only against the middle one of
the Gorgons, the Medusa, for she alone is mortal.
When you have recognized her, raise this gleaming
shield in which her face will be mirrored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After these words, the immortals left the youth.
Approaching nearer, he saw the figure of the Gorgon
on his shield. He raised his sword and struck
off her head. He then seized it by the snaky
hair, fastened it to his shield, and hurried away.
The two living Gorgons awoke and swept the air
with their wings, but could not catch the youth, as
the cloak of Pluto hid him from their sight.</p>
<p>On his way back, Perseus came to Ethiopia.
The people there were in great trouble, for a dreadful
calamity had happened to them. The water
of the sea was in flood and had brought with it a
monster which devoured men and animals. The
oracle was consulted and gave this answer: &ldquo;Only
when Andromeda, the king&rsquo;s daughter, is given to the
sea monster for food will the flood abate.&rdquo; Although
the noble maiden was greatly beloved, there was a
universal demand to offer her up and save the country.
Andromeda was thereupon taken to a rock
and securely bound to it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>Flying through the air, Perseus saw the maiden.
He immediately descended and ascertained her
fate. Then he hastened to the king and asked him
if he would give his daughter to him for wife if he
freed the country from the monster. The king
promised that he would.</p>
<p>Perseus betook himself to the shore and awaited
the appearance of the monster. It soon emerged
from the water and made for the rocks to devour
the maiden. Perseus attacked and killed it after a
hard fight. The waves of the sea at once receded
and the country was freed from the pest. The
king gave the victor his daughter for wife and a
great festival was held in his honor.</p>
<p>After some time had elapsed, Perseus bethought
himself of the promise he had made King Polydectes
to bring him the Gorgon&rsquo;s head, and therefore
made his way with his wife to the island of Seriphus,
where Polydectes ruled in common with his
brother.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>How astonished Polydectes was when he saw
the hero returning whose death he had wished!
Perseus held the head of Medusa before the king.
The sight of it turned him to stone instantly. When
Polydectes had thus been punished, Perseus gave
the Medusa&rsquo;s head to Athene, who fastened it in
the middle of her breastplate. The shield, cloak,
and shoes he gave to Hermes, who returned them to
the nymphs.</p>
<p>Perseus now went back to Argos, his homeland.
When Acrisius heard he was approaching the castle,
he fled to the Pelasgians. Perseus followed him and
found him there. He implored him to return with
him to Argos and promised that he would do him
no harm. This reassured Acrisius and he agreed to
follow him.</p>
<p>On the day fixed for their departure a contest
was arranged by the Pelasgians in which Perseus
took part. He engaged in disk throwing and Perseus
struck his grandfather upon the foot with the
disk, which led to his illness and death. Thus the
prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
<p>Perseus lived long and happily with his wife Andromeda,
who bore him six sons and two daughters.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Cadmus</span></h2>
<p>Agenor, hearing of the extraordinary abduction
of Europa,<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> called his son Cadmus
to him and ordered him to bring back the
maiden or never again enter his house. Cadmus
wandered over the earth for a long time, but could
nowhere find his sister. As he did not dare to venture
home without her, he consulted the oracle
and asked where she might dwell.</p>
<p>The oracle replied: &ldquo;In a lonely field you will
find a young steer which has never worn a yoke.
Follow it, and where it lies down in the soft grass
to rest, there build a city. It shall be called Thebes,
and the country round about, B&oelig;otia.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>Cadmus left the cave in which he had heard
the voice of the deity and soon found the steer
which had never worn a yoke. He followed it with
his companions, humbly supplicating Apollo. The
steer led him afar, but at last stopped, turned its
head towards him and his companions, and loudly
lowed. Then it laid down in the soft grass.</p>
<p>Cadmus knelt down, kissed the soil, and greeted
the surrounding fields, mountains, and forests.
Then turning to his companions he said: &ldquo;Arise,
and bring water that we may make an offering to
Zeus, the all-powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a forest nearby which had never been
touched by the axe. In the centre of this forest
they found a cavern, grown round about with
bushes, from which an abundance of water gushed.
This cavern was the lair of a dragon. The body of
the monster was swollen with poison. Fire darted
from its eyes, its crest gleamed golden, its tongue
was thrice cloven, and there were triple rows of
teeth in its jaws.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>As the men, suspecting no danger, made their
way through the forest, they heard the plashing of
water. Joyously they hastened towards it and came
to the cavern. But hardly had they dipped their
buckets into the water before the dragon awoke
from its sleep. It raised itself and beheld the victims
who had approached it so unsuspectingly.
Suddenly the men heard a frightful hissing, and
as they looked around they saw the dragon&rsquo;s
bluish head emerging from the cavern. They
dropped their buckets. Their faces grew deadly
pale and their limbs trembled. In the meantime
the dragon coiled its scaly body and arched itself
over the men so that they could not fly. Not one
of them escaped. The monster tore some with its
teeth, killed some by strangling them in its coils,
and the rest were killed by the poisonous breath
from its throat.</p>
<p>It was already midday, and as the men had not
returned, Cadmus decided to search for them. He
threw around him the shaggy lion&rsquo;s skin which
served for a cloak and donned his glittering helmet.
He took two spears with him. He had not
gone far before he saw the dragon and under it his
dead companions, whose wounds the horrible monster
was licking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will have revenge or die like you,&rdquo; he cried.
He seized a huge rock and hurled it at the dragon
with such force that it might have shattered a tower,
but it did not harm the monster. The rock glanced
from its scaly hide and fell heavily to the ground.
Deep into its back he hurled a spear, the point of
which penetrated its entrails. The monster reared,
bent its neck, and seized the spear with its teeth.
It jerked it one side and the other powerfully and
at last tore it out. But it had only taken out the
handle. The iron remained sticking in the entrails.
In its fury its eyes flashed fire terribly, its veins
and throat swelled, and white foam flew from
its poisonous jaws. Next it coiled itself, with
a terrible rattling of its scales, and hurled itself
at Cadmus with the swiftness of lightning.
Cadmus sprang to one side and plunged his second
spear into the dragon&rsquo;s neck. The spear glanced,
the dragon turned its neck, seized it, and broke it
to pieces. Cadmus thereupon drew his sword and
drove it into its neck with such force that it not
only ran it through, but also penetrated an oak,
thus holding the dragon fastened to the tree. It
coiled itself around the trunk and lashed it with
its tail until it shook. Cadmus sprang back, for
the air was poisonous near the monster. Blood and
foam streamed from its neck and at last it died.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>As Cadmus advanced to look at the monster,
Athene suddenly appeared at his side and said:
&ldquo;Cadmus, make a circle in the ground with your
sword and furrow it and sow in the furrows the
teeth of the dead dragon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Athene disappeared and Cadmus set about the
work. He furrowed the soil with his strong arms,
took the dragon&rsquo;s teeth, scattered them in the furrows,
and covered them with earth. Lo, instantly
the clods stirred, spear points pierced upwards,
followed by glittering helmets, bearded heads, and
at last the bodies of armed men. The human
crop increased until at last a troop of warriors stood
before him. Cadmus sprang to his weapons, but
one of the warriors said: &ldquo;Do not arm yourself,
Cadmus, but avoid the contest.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Thereupon the warriors began to attack each
other and a mighty struggle ensued. Only five of
them survived. Their weapons were thrown to the
ground and they made peace with each other.
The five followed the brave Cadmus and helped
him to build the city upon the spot designated
by the oracle. He named it Thebes, as Apollo
had ordered.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Dionysus (Bacchus)</span></h2>
<p>Dionysus (Bacchus) was the son of Zeus
and Semele, daughter of Cadmus of
Thebes. By the orders of Zeus the child
was intrusted to Hermes, to be taken to Nysa,
a majestic island with clear flowing streams and
ever green meadows. The fruit-bearing trees are
covered with vine clusters and the ocean breezes
temper the sun&rsquo;s heat. In the midst of this island
is a beautiful valley. The tops of the trees are so
closely interwoven that neither a sun ray nor a drop
of rain can penetrate them. There is a cavern
there, whose rocky arches gleam with variegated
colors. Upon either side are lofty trees, some in
continual blossom, others loaded with spicy fruit.
Brilliantly plumaged birds nest in the trees and their
songs are wonderfully melodious. Flowers grow
beneath the trees, filling the air with perennial
perfume. There are also resting places for the
nymphs there; not made by men, but fashioned by
nature. One never sees a withered flower there, nor
a dry leaf, nor a trace of decay.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Hermes took the child there to be brought up
by the nymphs. The boy, named Dionysus (Bacchus),
grew rapidly and travelled over various countries
to teach men vine growing. He went to Egypt
and Syria and received from Rhea, mother of
Zeus, his India coat, variegated deerskin, and
thyrsus. He next passed through the golden vales
of Lydia, the sunny plains of Phrygia and Persia,
and the rough country of Media. He visited Arabia
the blest and nearly all Asia paid him reverence.
He rode in a gold-gleaming chariot, drawn by leopards.
A multitude of cupids, nymphs, fauns, and
satyrs followed him. The old and continually
drunken Silenus also belonged to his retinue, which
accompanied its p&aelig;ans with the clash of cymbals
and the music of Phrygian flutes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>Once it happened that Silenus fell asleep in a wood
and was left behind. Some Lydian peasants found
the old man and carried him upon a litter of branches
to their king, Midas, at whose palace Bacchus later
arrived. Finding that Silenus had been hospitably
entertained, Bacchus assured Midas that any
wish of his should be granted. Midas requested
that whatever he touched might turn to gold. The
request was granted, but Midas soon found that
his wish would prove fatal, for not only water and
wine, but fruit and all kinds of food, turned to gold
when he touched them. Repenting his folly, he
implored Bacchus to recall the gift. Taking pity
upon him, Bacchus ordered him to bathe in the river
Pactolus, having done which, he was soon relieved.
From that time the sands of that river became
gold.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>Dionysus next came to the country of Edoni,
free passage through which had been promised him
by Lycurgus, its prince. When he encamped in
the woods with his train he was suddenly attacked
by the treacherous prince. He placed himself
under the protection of the sea goddess, Thetis,
but he and his retinue were taken prisoners and
fettered. The punishment of this misdeed came
quickly. Lycurgus was seized by an incurable
madness, and thinking his own son was a vine he
cut off his hands and feet with an axe. But when
he saw the bleeding body lying upon the earth he
realized what he had done and released Bacchus.
But retribution was not yet complete. The earth
bore nothing for his people a whole year long. The
Edonians in despair consulted the oracle, which
announced that full compensation could be rendered
only by the death of the king. He was
seized and taken to the mountain of Pangaeus
where he was torn to pieces by wild horses.</p>
<p>Bacchus next went to Thebes, the city of his
birth. The palace was in ashes and his mother
had perished in it, struck down by Zeus&rsquo; thunderbolts.
The gray Cadmus was still living, but no
longer ruled the city. Pentheus was its prince and
to him came the blind seer Tiresias announcing the
approach of Bacchus. He was enraged at the words
of the seer and rebuked the Thebans when he saw
them arraying themselves to meet him. &ldquo;Is it
possible,&rdquo; he exclaimed, &ldquo;that you have forgotten
your origin? Your fathers were heroes and you
would bow before a boy who smears his tresses with
balsams, wears a wreath of vine leaves in place of
a helmet, and a purple cloak in place of armor?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>Thereupon he despatched his servants with orders
to seize Bacchus and bind him. His friends were
alarmed when they heard this order. Their entreaties
were useless; he only adhered more firmly
to his purpose. It was not long before the servants
returned, bringing Bacchus in fetters. Pentheus
said to his people jubilantly: &ldquo;Now, you know
what fools you were,&rdquo; and ordered Bacchus to be
imprisoned. Then he sent his servants to arrest
the whole train, when something wonderful occurred.
The earth shook, flames played about the columns
of the palace, and Bacchus rose in majesty from
his prison. The king was terrified and tried to
escape. But he could not avoid his punishment.
He was suddenly seized with a longing to witness
the revels of Bacchus&rsquo; followers. Bacchus ordered
that he should appear to them as a wild animal.
With fearful cries the Bacchantes rushed upon him
and killed him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>From Thebes Bacchus went to Argos, and from
thence he decided to cross over to Naxos, and made
his arrangements with some sea robbers. Not
knowing him, they decided to sell him as a slave
and pass by Naxos. Suddenly they beheld a stream
of wine flowing over the deck and filling the whole
vessel with its perfume. Red clusters of grapes
hung from the sails. Wreaths of flowers and fruits
extended up the mast to the pennant. The crew
were overcome with astonishment. &ldquo;A divinity
directs the ship,&rdquo; cried the most sensible of them;
&ldquo;let us sail to Naxos.&rdquo; But it was too late. Bacchus
suddenly stood on the deck in the form of a
lion, seized the leader of the pirates, and tore him
to pieces. When the others saw his fate, they sprang
into the sea and were changed to dolphins. Thus
Bacchus punished their misdeeds. After founding
many temples he took his mother Semele to
Olympus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XIV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Act&aelig;on</span></h2>
<p>Act&aelig;on was the son of the hunt-loving
deity, Arist&aelig;us, and Autono&euml;, daughter
of Cadmus. When he had passed the
childhood age he was taken to the woody mountain
of Pelion by the wise centaur, Chiron, and trained
as a robust hunter. It was his greatest pleasure to
hunt in the valleys and mountains. One day he
hunted with some jovial companions in the forests
of Mount Cith&aelig;ron until midday, when it grew so
hot that he rested in the cool shade of the trees.
While reposing, he called his companions to him
and said: &ldquo;We have game enough. Our steel and
traps are drenched with blood. Let us end hunting
for to-day. When the sun rises in the morning we
will resume the joyous sport.&rdquo; Thus he spoke and
dismissed his willing companions. Then he went
with his hounds deeper into the forest to find a
cool, shadowy spot where he could sleep through the
heat of the noon and rest his wearied limbs.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>He reached a valley full of fir trees and lofty
cypresses, called Gargaphia, which was sacred to
Artemis. Deep in a corner of the valley he found
a leafy grotto. The rocky arch seemed to be the
product of human skill, but was the work of nature.
A stream murmured gently along, whose clear
water, bordered by green turf, broadened out into
a wide pool. This was the spot where the goddess,
tired with the chase, bathed her sacred limbs. She
was in the grotto, attended by her nymphs, one of
whom took her hunting spear and bow. Another
relieved the goddess of her cloak, and two of them
unloosed her sandals. The beautiful Crocale, cleverest
of them all, fastened her tresses together in a
knot. Then her attendants filled urns with water
and poured it over the goddess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>While the goddess was thus enjoying her bath,
Act&aelig;on approached through the bushes by an untrodden
way. Evil destiny led him to the sacred
haunt of Artemis&rsquo; grotto. Unsuspecting any harm,
he entered, delighted to have found such a cool
resting place. When the nymphs beheld a man,
they cried aloud and crowded about their mistress
to conceal her with their bodies; but being a head
taller, the goddess towered above them all. Her
glowing face wore a wrathful look, and her eyes were
sternly fixed upon the intruder, who stood motionless,
surprised, and dazzled by the wondrous sight.</p>
<p>It would have been better for the unfortunate Act&aelig;on
had he fled at once, for the goddess suddenly
bent her head, dipped up water with her hand,
sprinkled it over the face and hair of the youth,
and said in a threatening tone: &ldquo;What thou hast
seen, now tell to men, if thou canst.&rdquo; Hardly had
the last word been uttered when unspeakable distress
seized him. Swiftly he dashed off, and in his running
was amazed by his speed. The unfortunate
one did not notice that antlers sprang from his head,
that his neck was longer, that his ears were pointed,
his arms changed to legs, and his hands to hoofs.
His limbs were covered with a dappled skin. He was
no longer a man, but had been changed by the wrathful
goddess to a stag. As he fled, he saw his image
mirrored in the water. &ldquo;Woe is me,&rdquo; he would have
cried, but his voice was mute and no word escaped
from his groaning breast. He could only utter a
sigh of despair. Tears poured from his eyes, but
not upon human cheeks. Only his heart, his old
recollection, remained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>What should he do now? Return to his grandfather&rsquo;s
palace? Conceal himself in the depths of
the forest? While thus torn by the conflicting emotions
of fear and shame, his hounds saw him. The
whole pack, fifty in number, rushed upon the imaginary
stag. Eager for their prey, they chased him
over mountain and valley, jagged rocks and yawning
abysses. Thus the despairing one, himself
the hunted, fled over well-known regions where
he had often hunted wild animals. Twice he
would have turned and cried, &ldquo;Spare me! I am Act&aelig;on.&rdquo;
But he was speechless. Baying furiously,
the leader of the pack overtook him and seized
him by the neck, while all the others rushed upon
him and tore him with their sharp teeth. The
victim groaned heavily; no stag ever groaned that
way, and yet it was not a human groan. Like one
praying he fell upon his knees, and in mute anguish
turned his face towards his assailants. At this
instant his companions, hearing the baying of the
hounds, came up. With their usual call they incited
the hounds and then shouted for their master,
whom they believed was not far away. &ldquo;Act&aelig;on,&rdquo;
rang through the forest, &ldquo;where art thou? Come
and behold this wonderful capture.&rdquo; Thus they
cried as the unfortunate victim was killed by the
spears of his own friends.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>After Act&aelig;on had thus wretchedly perished, his
hounds began to miss their loved master. Baying
and whining, they sought the lost one everywhere,
until at last they came to Chiron&rsquo;s cavern. Chiron
made a bronze image of Act&aelig;on so much like him
that it deceived them. When the hounds saw it
they sprang upon it, licked the hands and feet, and
acted as joyfully as if they had found their real
master again.</p>

<h2 id="c15"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">D&aelig;dalus and Icarus</span></h2>
<p>D&aelig;dalus of Athens was a son of Metion,
grandson of Erectheus. He was
the most skilful man of his time&mdash;an
architect, sculptor, and stone worker. His works
were admired in various parts of the world, and his
statues were said to live, move, and see; for while
the statues of earlier artists had their eyes closed
and the hands not separated from the body, he was
the first one who gave open eyes to his statues,
extended the hands, and represented the feet as
walking. But skilful, zealous, and active as he
was in his work, he had vices which brought him
into trouble. He had a nephew, named Talos,
who was his pupil, and who displayed even more
skill than his uncle and master. He discovered
the potter&rsquo;s wheel. He also took the jaw of a
snake and copied it in iron, cutting into it a row of
continuous teeth, thus inventing the saw. He also
invented the lathe and many useful instruments
without assistance from his teacher, which made him
famous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>D&aelig;dalus, fearing that the name of his scholar
might become more renowned than his own,
grew so jealous that he killed the boy by hurling
him down from the castle at Athens. While
engaged in burying him, he was surprised by the
authorities and pretended he was burying a snake.
At last he was brought before the Areopagus,
charged with murder, and was found guilty. He
managed to escape, however, and at first wandered
about in Attica, but finally fled to the island of
Crete. There he met King Minos, became his
friend, and was highly esteemed as a renowned artist.
He was chosen to make a house for the Minotaur,
a monster resembling a bull from its head to its
shoulders, the remainder of its body being like a
man, and to construct it so that the monster would
be entirely removed from human sight. The inventive
genius of D&aelig;dalus produced the Labyrinth,
a structure full of complicated windings,
confusing both to the eyes and feet of those who
entered it. When it was finished and D&aelig;dalus
began to look it over, the builder himself found
his way back to the opening only with the greatest
difficulty. The Minotaur was kept in the very
centre of this Labyrinth, its food being seven youths
and seven maidens sent to it periodically from
Athens.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>In the meantime D&aelig;dalus began to weary of his
long banishment from home. It vexed him that
he must spend his life upon an island exposed to
the caprices of a tyrannical and cruel king. After
long consideration, he at last joyfully exclaimed:
&ldquo;I have found the way to escape. Minos may be
master of land and water, but the sky is free to
me. He has no power over that. Through the
air I will escape.&rdquo; No sooner said than done. He
began by arranging bird feathers of different sizes
in regular order. These feathers he fastened in the
middle with waxed linen cords. He then bent the
joined feathers in such perfect curves that they
clearly resembled wings. D&aelig;dalus had a boy,
named Icarus, who stood by him and eagerly
meddled, childlike, with his father&rsquo;s work. All of a
sudden he took some of the feathers and deftly
kneaded the wax, which his father had been using,
with his thumb and forefinger. The father smiled at
the unassisted exertions of the child. After his work
was finished D&aelig;dalus fastened the wings to his body,
balanced them equally, and sailed through the air
as lightly as a bird. Then, descending to earth,
he constructed a smaller pair for his son and instructed
him how to use them. &ldquo;Always fly, my
dear son, in the middle course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If you
fly too low your wings may become so dampened by
the sea air that they will grow heavy and you may
fall into the waves, and if you mount too high and
go too near the sunbeams your feathers may suddenly
take fire. Fly between sea and sky and always
follow in my course.&rdquo; After these warnings D&aelig;dalus
fastened his wings on Icarus&rsquo; shoulders, though
the old man&rsquo;s hands trembled as he did so, and
anxious tears dropped upon them. He then embraced
his son and kissed him for the last time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>The two rose in air. The father led the way, flying
as natural as a bird. He moved his wings easily and
skilfully and from time to time looked back to see
how his son was succeeding. They soon passed the
island of Samos at the left and flew by the islands
of Delos and Paros. Several other localities were left
behind them when suddenly Icarus, who had grown
over-confident, forsook his paternal guide to reach a
higher altitude. He soon encountered the danger
his father predicted. The proximity of the sun
weakened the wax which held his wings together
and they became detached from his shoulders.
The unfortunate youth tried to keep in air with
his bare arms, but it was in vain and he suddenly
plunged downwards with the name of his father on
his lips; but before he could call for help he sank in
the sea&rsquo;s blue depths. It all happened so quickly
that D&aelig;dalus, when he looked back for his son,
could see nothing of him. &ldquo;Icarus, Icarus,&rdquo; he
shouted in the vacant sky, &ldquo;where and in what
region of air shall I seek thee?&rdquo; At last he cast
an anxious glance downward and saw the feathers
floating on the water. He descended and wandered
from shore to shore seeking the body of his unfortunate
child, and at last found it. The murder of
Talos was avenged. The despairing father attended
to the burial of his son, upon an island which
in lasting memory of the tragic event is called
Icaria.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>After D&aelig;dalus had buried his son he went to the
large island of Sicily, where King Cocalus ruled.
He met with the same hospitable reception which
Minos once extended to him, and his skill created
universal astonishment. He constructed an artificial
lake from which issued a broad river emptying
into the neighboring sea. Upon a barren and
almost insurmountable cliff, which had hardly room
for a couple of trees, he built a strong fortress
approached by a winding way which could be
defended by three or four men. King Cocalus
used this impregnable castle as a storehouse for his
treasures. The third work of D&aelig;dalus was a deep
cavern on the island of Sicily. Here he overcame the
reek of internal fires so skilfully that a visit to the
cavern, which was usually so damp, became as
agreeable as if it were a mildly warmed room and
the body experienced a gentle perspiration without
being overheated. He also enlarged the temple
of Aphrodite (Venus) upon Mount Eryx<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a> and dedicated
to the goddess a golden honeycomb so skilfully
made that it was difficult to tell it from a
real one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>When King Minos, whose island D&aelig;dalus forsook,
learned that he had fled to Sicily he resolved
to follow him with a strong force. He organized
a fleet and set out from Crete to Agrigentum.
There he disembarked his troops and sent messengers
to King Cocalus, demanding the surrender of
the fugitive. But Cocalus was enraged at this invasion
by a foreign tyrant and determined to find some
way of destroying him. He pretended to consent,
promised to comply with his wishes in every way,
and invited him to an interview. Minos came and
was received by Cocalus with the greatest hospitality.
A warm bath was prepared to relieve him
of fatigue, but when he sat in the tub it was so soon
overheated that Minos was suffocated. The king
sent his body to the Cretans who came with him,
informing them that Minos had slipped and fallen
into the hot water in the tub. Minos was taken
with great pomp by his warriors to Agrigentum and
above his grave a temple of Venus was built. D&aelig;dalus
remained in the continuous favor of Cocalus,
educated many famous artists, and was the founder
of art in Sicily. But he was never happy after
the death of his son, and while he enriched the country
which had given him refuge, with beautiful
art works, his old age was sorrowful and full of
troubles. He died upon the island and was buried
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<h2 id="c16"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Philemon and Baucis</span></h2>
<p>Upon a hill in the land of Phrygia stands
a thousand year old oak, and close by
it a linden of the same age, both surrounded
by a low wall. Many a wreath has been
hung upon the boughs of the neighborly pair. Not
far from them extends a swampy lake into which
empties a shallow stream. Where in former times
people dwelt, now only herons and ducks rove about.
Once Father Zeus came to this spot with his son
Hermes carrying only his wand, but not his winged
cap. They were seeking hospitality in human form.
They knocked at a thousand doors praying shelter
for the night. But the people were so disobliging
that the heavenly visitants could not anywhere
find lodging. At the end of the village was a
hut, humble and small, covered with straw and
rushes. In this poor house lived a happy couple,
honest Philemon and Baucis, his wife, of the same
age. They had spent their joyous youth together
there, and there they had grown white-haired.
They made no complaint of their poverty, but quietly
bore their hard lot, united in love, and although
childless, they were content in the mean little house
which they alone occupied together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>As the high deities approached this humble
roof and entered the low passageway with bowed
heads, the honest couple met them with a hearty
greeting. The old man placed seats for them, and
Baucis, clad in a coarse dress, begged them to rest
themselves. The little mother busied herself about
the hearth, stirred up the ashes, piled up dry leaves
and brushwood, and kindled a fire. Then she
brought split wood and placed it under the little
kettle hanging over the fire. In the meantime
Philemon brought cabbage from his well-watered
garden, deftly unleaved it, took down a side of
smoked pork with his two-tined fork from the ceiling,
and cut a huge piece from the shoulder to put
into the boiling water. That the time might not
seem too long to the strangers, they exerted themselves
to entertain them with light conversation.
They also poured water into the wooden tub so
that they could enjoy a foot bath. Smiling in a
friendly way, the gods accepted these proffers, and
while they were stretching their feet comfortably in
the water their gracious host prepared the couch-bed,
which stood in the middle of the room. The
cushions were stuffed with rushes and the feet and
frame were made of woven willow. Philemon
brought carpetings which were only kept for feast
days,&mdash;how old and poor they were!&mdash;and the
divine guests prepared to enjoy the meal which was
now ready. The little mother, in her neat apron,
placed with trembling hands the three-legged table
before the couch, and as it would not stand very
securely, she raised it slightly by placing something
under it. Then she rubbed the plates with fresh
mint and food was set before them. There were
olives, cornelian cherries, preserved in clear thick
sirup, also radishes, endives, fine cheese, and eggs
cooked in the ashes. Baucis brought all these in
earthen dishes, besides a showily colored pitcher and
neat cups of beechwood, glazed on the inside with
yellow wax, filled with milk, for they had no wine.
Nuts, figs, and dates were brought for desert, and
two dishes filled with plums and spicy apples. In
the middle of the table was a whitish honeycomb.
But the finest seasoning of the meal was the good
friendly faces of the honest old couple, testifying to
their honesty and generosity.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>As all were enjoying the food and drink, Philemon
observed that the pitcher contained wine
instead of milk and that in spite of emptying
of the cups they were continually refilled. Then
he recognized with surprise and fear whom he
was entertaining. In distress he flew to his old
companion with upraised arms and downcast
eyes and implored her to know what they should
offer to their heavenly guests. Suddenly it occurred
to them that they might offer their only goose.
Both ran out, but the goose was faster than they.
Hissing and flapping its wings, it ran here and there,
outdistancing the old people. Finally it ran into
the house and crouched behind the guests, as if
seeking divine protection. And it did not seek in
vain.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>The guests restrained the ardor of the old people
and said with a laugh: &ldquo;We are gods who have
come to earth to test the generosity of men. We
found your neighbors wicked and they shall be punished.
But you shall leave this house and follow
us to the summit of the mountain, so that you shall
not suffer with the guilty ones.&rdquo; Both obeyed, and
leaning upon their staffs they wearisomely climbed
the mountain. They were not an arrow&rsquo;s flight
from the highest peak when they anxiously looked
down and saw the whole place changed into a raging
waste of waters, and of all the houses only their
own little one remained. While they stood astonished
and bewailed the fate of the others, behold
the poor old hut towered above the waters as a
temple. A golden roof was supported on its columns
and its floors were of marble. Zeus turned
to the trembling old people and said: &ldquo;Tell me,
honest old man and worthy wife of the honest old
man, what do you most wish?&rdquo; Philemon exchanged
a few words with his wife and then said:
&ldquo;We would be your priests. Permit us to serve
in that temple. And as we have so long lived
together, let us die at the same hour. Then I
shall never see the grave of my dear wife nor will
she have to bury me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>Their wish was granted. As long as they
lived they served in the temple. And once,
when weary with the weight of age and years,
they were standing on the sacred steps, thinking
of their wonderful fate, Baucis saw her Philemon
and Philemon his Baucis disappearing and
floating away to the distant height. &ldquo;Farewell,
dear one. Farewell, beloved one,&rdquo; said each as
long as they could speak. Thus ended the worthy
pair. He was turned into an oak and she into a
linden, and thus they remained as close together in
death as they had been in life. Goodness is prized
by the gods. They bestow honors upon those who
prove themselves worthy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Arachne</span></h2>
<p>In Hypaipa, a little city of Lydia, dwelt a maiden
of lowly birth named Arachne. Idmon, her
father, was a dyer at Colophon and her mother,
who died early, was born of poor parents. The name
of Arachne was famous in Lydia, for she surpassed
all human women in skill and industry in weaving.
The nymphs of the vine-clad mountain of Tmolus
and of the river Pactolus came to her poor cottage
to watch her work. Never were skill and grace
more closely united. Whether she was first preparing
the coarse wool, or drawing the threads finer
and finer, or revolving the spindle with nimble
thumbs, or stitching with the needle, it always seemed
as if Pallas Athene herself must have instructed
her. Arachne knew nothing about it, but she often
declared in an offended tone: &ldquo;I did not get my skill
from the goddess. Let her come and try her skill
with me. If she defeats me I will bear any penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>Athene was very angry when she heard this
boast, assumed the form of a little old woman,
covered her brow with gray hair, and leaning for
support upon a staff, came to Arachne&rsquo;s cottage
and thus began: &ldquo;The years bring experience to
gray old age. Therefore despise not my advice.
Seek for the glory of surpassing all mortals with
your skill, but meekly submit to the gods. Implore
pardon for your haughty words and all will
be forgiven you.&rdquo; Arachne&rsquo;s countenance darkened,
and she angrily replied: &ldquo;Thou art foolish,
old one. The burden of the years has weakened thy
senses. It is not good to live long. Preach such
silliness to thy daughter. I need none of thy advice
and spurn thy admonitions. Why does not
Pallas herself come? Why does she avoid the trial
with me?&rdquo; The goddess could not longer restrain
herself. &ldquo;She is here now,&rdquo; she cried, as she
threw off her disguise and stood before her in her
own image.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The nymphs and the Lydian women who were
present fell humbly at her feet, but Arachne did
not tremble. A fleeting blush reddened her face
and she resolutely adhered to her purpose. Urged
on by her foolish vanity, she exposed herself to
the penalty of which she had been warned. The
daughter of Zeus lost no time in further attempts
to dissuade her, but undertook the trial. Seating
themselves, the weaving began. Purple and a
thousand other colors, distracting to eyes not used
to them, were skilfully woven together. Threads
of gold ran through the webs, and wonderful pictures
astonished the eyes of the spectators. Athene
fashioned the cliffs of the Athenian mount and their
contest with the sea god for possession of the land.
Twelve gods with Zeus in the centre sat there, serious
and dignified. Here stood Poseidon as he struck
the rocks with his trident. There appeared the
goddess herself, the divine artist, armed with shield
and lance, her helmet on her head, the terrible
&aelig;gis on her breast, teaching men for the first time
the culture of the olive tree, and causing it to spring
from the unfruitful earth with the point of her spear.
Thus Athene wove her own victory in the web.
In the four corners she worked four examples of
human pride which have tragic results from the
vengeance of the gods. In the first corner were
the Thracian king, Harnus, and his wife Rhodope,
who called themselves Zeus and Hera and were
changed into mountain peaks. In another corner
was the unhappy mother of the Pygm&aelig;i, who,
overcome by Hera, was changed to a crane, and fought
her own children. In the third corner was Antigone,
the charming daughter of Laomedon, who was
so proud of her beauty and her tresses that she
likened herself to Hera. The goddess changed her
tresses to snakes which bit and tormented her until
Zeus, pitying her, turned her into a stork. In
the last Pallas pictured Einyras, weeping over the
fate of his daughter, who because of her pride was
changed by Hera to a stone step before one of her
temples. All these pictures Athene wove and surrounded
them with a wreath of olive leaves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>Arachne wove in her web many pictures illustrating
the disreputable actions of Zeus and surrounded
them with a wreath of ivy and blossoms. When
she had finished her work Athene could not find
fault with the skill of the maiden, but she was
enraged with the sacrilege of the weaver. She
suddenly tore the web to pieces and struck the
maiden three times on the forehead with the spindle
which she held in her hand. The unfortunate
one could not endure this. Madness seized her and
she hanged herself with a rope. As she was suspended
in the air, the goddess had compassion upon
her and said: &ldquo;Live, but hang there, thou audacious
one. And so shall thy whole race to the latest
generation be punished.&rdquo; With these words she
sprinkled Arachne with a few magic drops and went
away. The hair, nose, and ears of the maiden
disappeared and she shrank into a small and noxious
insect. And the spider to-day still weaves its web&mdash;the
old art.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="h2line1">Chapter XVIII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">Hyacinthus</span></h2>
<p>The youngest of the sons of the Laconian
king, Amyclas, was Hyacinthus. Ph&oelig;bus
Apollo beheld the beautiful boy, who
soon became his favorite. He sought at first to
elevate him to Olympus that he might be ever near
him; but a sad fate prevented this and cut him
down in the very flower of his youth.</p>
<p>Apollo often forsook sacred Delphi in order
to enjoy the company of his favorite at the
river of Eurotas in the neighborhood of the
unwalled city of Sparta. He left his lyre and
bow and joined Hyacinthus in hunting among
the hills of Taygetus. Once at noontime, when
the sun was sending down its hottest rays, both
threw aside their garments, anointed their bodies
with oil, and began throwing the discus.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Apollo was the first to take the heavy weight and
hurled it so powerfully that it pierced the clouds.
He waited long for the discus to fall to earth again.
Eager to imitate his teacher, the boy sprang forward
to make his throw, but suddenly was felled
to the earth by Apollo&rsquo;s discus. Apollo rushed to
him and sought to animate his stiffened limbs. He
wiped the blood from the dreadful wounds, applied
healing balms, and sought to stay the fleeing spirit
of his favorite. But it was in vain. Like a broken
flower in the garden, the poor boy&rsquo;s head drooped,
exhausted, upon Apollo&rsquo;s breast. Apollo called
him tender names and bedewed his face with bitter
tears. Oh, that he were not a god so that he might
die for him!</p>
<p>At last he cried out: &ldquo;No, sweet child, thou
shalt not wholly die. As a flower thou shalt tell
of my sorrow.&rdquo; As Apollo said this, lo, from the
streaming blood which reddened the grass sprang a
flower of dark lustre like Tyrian purple, lily formed
upon a stalk rich in blossoms, and showing upon its
little leaves in clear form the sigh of the god: &ldquo;A I,
A I&rdquo;; that is, &ldquo;Alas! Alas!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>Thus originated the Spring flower which bears
the name of the favorite of the god and speedily
dies as did he&mdash;a type of the transitoriness
of all beautiful things on earth. In Laconia when
the Summer came they always had a great festival
in honor of Hyacinthus and his divine friends,
the hyacinths, whereby they kept the boy in memory&mdash;sorrowfully,
as one who perished early, but
joyously, as one beloved of the gods and deified.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
